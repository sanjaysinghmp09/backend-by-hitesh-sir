## Install

Cloudinary's Node.js integration library is available as an open-source NPM package. To install the library, run:

```
npm install cloudinary
```

> **NOTE**: Check that you're using a [supported version](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm#version-support) of Node.js.

## Configure

Include Cloudinary's Node.js classes in your code:

```nodejs
const cloudinary = require('cloudinary');
```

> **INFO**:
>
> The Node.js SDK upload and admin method syntax examples shown throughout this documentation use the **v2** signature. To avoid confusion, all code examples use the format `cloudinary.v2...`.  &nbsp;
> In your own code, it's recommended to include `v2` of the Node.js classes as follows:
> ```nodejs
const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;
```
> Alternatively, from within a module, you can use an ES6 import statement:
> ```nodejs
import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary'
```
> Following either of these, your upload and Admin API calls should omit the `.v2` shown in the code examples of this guide. For example, a simple image upload:
> ```nodejs
cloudinary.uploader
  .upload("my_image.jpg")
  .then(result=>console.log(result)); 
```

### Set required configuration parameters

You can set the required configuration parameters, `cloud_name`, `api_key` and `api_secret` either using the `CLOUDINARY_URL` environment variable, or using the `config` method in your code.

To define the `CLOUDINARY_URL` environment variable:

1. Copy the **API environment variable** format from the [API Keys](https://console.cloudinary.com/app/settings/api-keys) page of the Cloudinary Console Settings. 
2. Replace `<your_api_key>` and `<your_api_secret>` with your actual values. Your cloud name is already correctly included in the format. 
 
For example:

```
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://my_key:my_secret@my_cloud_name
```
> **NOTE**: When using Cloudinary through a PaaS add-on, such as Heroku, this environment variable is automatically defined in your deployment environment.

Alternatively, you can use the `config` method to set your `cloud_name`, `api_key` and `api_secret`, for example:

```nodejs
cloudinary.config({ 
  cloud_name: 'my_cloud_name', 
  api_key: 'my_key', 
  api_secret: 'my_secret'
});
```

> **INFO**:
>
> * When writing your own applications, follow your organization's policy on storing secrets and don't expose your API secret. * If you use a method that involves writing your environment variable to a file (e.g. `dotenv`), exclude the file from your version control system, so as not to expose it publicly.
> **TIP**: To generate transformation URLs, you only need to configure the cloud name. The API key and API secret aren't required for URL generation.
### Set additional configuration parameters

In addition to the required configuration parameters, you can define a number of optional [configuration parameters](cloudinary_sdks#configuration_parameters) if relevant.

You can append configuration parameters, for example `upload_prefix` and `secure_distribution`, to the environment variable:

```
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://my_key:my_secret@my_cloud_name?secure_distribution=mydomain.com&upload_prefix=https://api-eu.cloudinary.com
```

Or you can use the `config` method in your code, for example:

```nodejs
cloudinary.config({ 
  cloud_name: 'my_cloud_name', 
  api_key: 'my_key', 
  api_secret: 'my_secret',
  secure_distribution: 'mydomain.com',
  upload_prefix: 'https://api-eu.cloudinary.com'
});
```

> **NOTE**: By default, URLs generated with this SDK include an appended SDK-usage query parameter. Cloudinary tracks aggregated data from this parameter to improve future SDK versions. We don't collect any individual data. If needed, you can disable the `urlAnalytics` configuration option. [Learn more](cloudinary_sdks#analytics_config).

## Use

Once you've installed and configured the Node.js SDK, you can use it for:
* **Uploading files to your product environment**: You can upload any files, not only images and videos, set your own naming conventions and overwrite policies, moderate and tag your assets on upload, and much more. [See&nbsp;example](#quick_example_file_upload)
* **Transforming and optimizing images and videos**: Keeping your original assets intact in your product environment, you can deliver different versions of your media - different sizes, formats, with effects and overlays, customized for your needs. [See&nbsp;example](#quick_example_transform_and_optimize)
* **Managing assets**: Using methods from the Admin and Upload APIs, you can organize your assets, for example, list, rename and delete them, add tags and metadata and use advanced search capabilities. [See&nbsp;example](#quick_example_get_details_of_a_single_asset)

Capitalization and data type guidelines...

When using the Node.js SDK, keep these guidelines in mind:  

* Parameter names: `snake_case`. For example: **public\_id**
* Classes: `PascalCase`. For example: **PreloadedFile**
* Methods: `snake_case`. For example: **image\_upload\_tag**
* Pass parameter data as: `Object`
* You can optionally use TypeScript. For details, see the [TypeScript declaration file](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/blob/master/types/index.d.ts).

### Quick example: File upload

The following Node.js code uploads the `dog.mp4` video using the public\_id, `my_dog`. The video overwrites the existing `my_dog` video if it exists. When the video upload finishes, the specified notification URL receives details about the uploaded media asset.

```nodejs
cloudinary.v2.uploader
.upload("dog.mp4", {
  resource_type: "video", 
  public_id: "my_dog",
  overwrite: true, 
  notification_url: "https://mysite.example.com/notify_endpoint"})
.then(result=>console.log(result)); 
```

> **Learn more about upload**:

> * Read the [Upload guide](upload_images) to learn more about customizing uploads, using upload presets and more.

> * See more examples of [image and video upload](node_image_and_video_upload) using the Cloudinary Node.js library.  

> * Explore the [Upload API reference](image_upload_api_reference) to see all available methods and options.

### Quick example: Transform and optimize

Take a look at the following transformation code and the image it delivers:

![sample transformation](https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_thumb,g_face,h_150,w_150/r_20/e_sepia/l_cloudinary_icon/e_brightness:90/o_60/c_scale,w_50/fl_layer_apply,g_south_east,x_5,y_5/a_10/q_auto/front_face.png "disable_all_tab: true, with_url: false, frameworks:nodejs")

```nodejs
cloudinary.image("front_face.png", {transformation: [
  {gravity: "face", height: 150, width: 150, crop: "thumb"},
  {radius: 20},
  {effect: "sepia"},
  {overlay: "cloudinary_icon"},
  {effect: "brightness:90"},
  {opacity: 60},
  {width: 50, crop: "scale"},
  {flags: "layer_apply", gravity: "south_east", x: 5, y: 5},
  {angle: 10},
  {quality: "auto"}
  ]})
```

This relatively simple code performs all of the following on the original front_face.jpg image before delivering it:

* **Crop** to a 150x150 thumbnail using face-detection gravity to automatically determine the location for the crop
* **Round the corners** with a 20 pixel radius
* Apply a **sepia effect**
* **Overlay the Cloudinary logo** on the southeast corner of the image (with a slight offset). Scale the logo overlay down to a 50 pixel width, with increased brightness and partial transparency (opacity = 60%).
* **Rotate** the resulting image (including the overlay) by 10 degrees
* **Optimize** the image to reduce the size of the image without impacting visual quality.
* **Convert** and deliver the image in PNG format (the originally uploaded image was a JPG)

And here's the URL that's automatically generated and included in an image tag from the above code:

![sample transformation](https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/c_thumb,g_face,h_150,w_150/r_20/e_sepia/l_cloudinary_icon/e_brightness:90/o_60/c_scale,w_50/fl_layer_apply,g_south_east,x_5,y_5/a_10/q_auto/front_face.png "disable_all_tab: true, with_code:false, with_image:false")

In a similar way, you can [transform a video](node_video_manipulation#video_transformation_examples).

> * See all possible transformations in the [Transformation URL API reference](transformation_reference).

### Quick example: Get details of a single asset

The following Node.js example uses the Admin API [resource](admin_api#get_details_of_a_single_resource_by_public_id) method to return details of the image with public ID `cld-sample`:

```nodejs
cloudinary.v2.api
  .resource('cld-sample')
  .then(result=>console.log(result));
```

#### Sample response
